# GreedyBear

The project goal is to extract data of the attacks detected by a TPOT or a cluster of them and to generate some feeds that can be used to prevent and detect attacks.

## Available Feeds
The feeds are reachable through the following URL: 
```
https://<greedybear_site>/api/feeds/<feed_type>/<attack_type>/<age>.<format>
```

The available `feed_type` are:

* `log4j`: attacks detected from the Log4pot.

The available `attack_type` are:

* `scanner`: IP addresses captured by the honeypots while performing attacks
* `payload_request`: IP addresses and domains extracted from payloads that would have been executed after a speficic attack would have been successful

The available `age` are:

* `recent`: most recent IOCs seen in the last 3 days
* `persistent`: these IOCs are the ones that were seen regularly by the honeypots. This feeds will start empty once no prior data was collected and will become bigger over time.

The available `format` are:

* `csv`: CSV-like file (just one line for each IOC)
* `json`: JSON file with additional information regarding the IOCs

## Public feeds

There are public feeds provided by The Honeynet Project in this site: greedybear.honeynet.org. [Example](https://greedybear.honeynet.org/api/feeds/log4j/all/recent.csv)

Please do not perform too many requests to extract feeds or you will be banned.

If you want to be updated regularly, please download the feeds only once every 10 minutes (this is the time between each internal update).
